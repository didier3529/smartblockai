# Task 7.17: Comprehensive Frontend Implementation and Backend Integration

## Status: in-progress
## Priority: high
## Dependencies: [7.16]

## Description
Implement the complete ChainOracle frontend interface with V0-generated components and connect it seamlessly to our backend services and adapters.

## Details
This task encompasses the full implementation of our ChainOracle frontend using the V0-generated UI components and their complete integration with our backend services. It includes setting up the core infrastructure layers (data fetching, WebSockets, authentication, etc.), implementing all main pages (Dashboard, Portfolio, Market Analysis, Smart Contracts, NFT, Settings), connecting data flows to backend adapters, adding real-time updates, implementing responsive behaviors, and ensuring comprehensive error handling throughout the application.

## Test Strategy
Test all page implementations for visual accuracy, responsive behavior, data integration, WebSocket connections, error states, and user interactions. Verify loading states, empty states, and edge cases. Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility. Validate that all backend data is properly displayed and updated in real-time.
